            <p>I was born in the town of Cholula in Puebla, MX, but my dad worked at an international company and was relocated
                to the United States. I grew up in McAllen, TX. It's a small suburbial city, with only one tiny museum, so
                I spent most of my time doing sports, reading, and drawing. I competed in gymnastics, tennis, swimming, volleyball,
                basketball, cross-country, and track and field. I wasn't the star of any of these sports, but I loved them.
                I loved being able to be a part of a team, be active, try and learn new things, and push to do my the best.

                class="biopix">
            <p>I did the IB program at Lamar Academy, which was ranked 9th in the nation, and 4th in the state, while doing
                sports, volunteering, etc. It was hard. But I found all of my classes interesting. I had a very strong desire
                to learn about the big world around me. I was the editor of the newspaper and yearbook for two years, vice
                president of student council, and a casual member of the chess club my last year. I was able to do all of
                these things because I had fun hanging out with my friends working on projects, I still do.

            <p>Northeastern University sits in the center of Boston, MA, far far away from McAllen, TX. Far different from the
                commuinty I knew. The opportunity for a completely new experience thrilled me. I wanted to taste East Coast
                life and now my perspectives and goals are even bigger.</p>

            <h4>Marketing</h4>
            <p>I decided to pursue Marketing because I am fascinated by understanding people and how they matter in a business
                context. Everyone is unique, but we all love certain things, people, animals, songs.
                <em>How are we different, how are we the same? And Why does it matter?</em> Marketing helps businesses understand
                their consumers and attract new ones. It's the process of finding a company's best method of understanding
                and communicating with the world and it's powerful, so I also study marketing to have a say in what companies
                say.

            <h4>Interactive Media</h4>
            <p> I also study Interactive Media. One of my favorite memories is the night of my high school art show. I displayed
                20 pieces I'd made in two years. I've always loved exploring my creativity and expressing myself through
                color, lines, and textures; and that night, I was able to show my friends and family a side that they did'nt
                all know about; and I was able to see their reactions. While I still love stuido art, I'm now more interested
                in
                <strong>design</strong> and how to best display things for people to understand the content while also exciting them.

            <h4>Computer Science</h4>
            <p>
                During Spring 2017 (Januaryâ€“June), I
                <dfn data-info="Northeastern has an experiential learning co-op program in which students do 6 month long internships to build on their classroom learning with real world experience.">co-oped</dfn> at Okta. It is a software company and I was in the Engineering Department, on the Information
                Development team. I had no notion of tech culture prior to my coop, but the work my engineering coworkers
                were doing interested me so much that I started learing how to code with online courses in my spare time.
                I was able to pitch and take on small projects for my team and after seven months at Okta, I wanted to learn
                more, so I added computer science as a minor. I am a third year student in a lecture hall full of mostly
                freshmen who have been coding for years; and coding differs from everything I've done in the past, but
                <em>it connects everything</em>. While definitely challenging, creating a program that works and learning something
                new while doing it, is so satisfying and very cool.

       <p>I've always enjoyed having a creative outlet. Find a few of my past projects in My Portfolio. Although I still paint and draw and explore physical mediums, I've become more excited by web design and animation. With web-design, I'm interested in learning how to change graphics, choose the best colors, and understanding the best practices for css. Animation, interests me because I love the idea of making images come to life. Ever since gifs took social media by a storm, I've seen the power of movement: it attracts more attention, and evokes emotion so much faster. I started learning animation with Pencil software, and have moved onto Adobe After Effects. I'll post my progress soon! </p>
