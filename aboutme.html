            <p>I was born in the town of Cholula in Puebla, MX, but my dad worked at an international company and was relocated
                to the United States. I grew up in McAllen, TX. It's a small suburbial city, with only one tiny museum, so
                I spent most of my time doing sports, reading, and drawing. I competed in gymnastics, tennis, swimming, volleyball,
                basketball, cross-country, and track and field. I wasn't the star of any of these sports, but I loved them.
                I loved being able to be a part of a team, be active, try and learn new things, and push to do my the best.

            <p>I did the IB program at Lamar Academy, which was ranked 9th in the nation, and 4th in the state, while doing
                sports, volunteering, etc. It was hard. But I found all of my classes interesting. I had a very strong desire
                to learn about the big world around me. I was the editor of the newspaper and yearbook for two years, vice
                president of student council, and a casual member of the chess club my last year. I had fun hanging out with
                friends and working on projects, I still do.

            <p>Northeastern University sits in the center of Boston, MA, far far away from McAllen, TX. Far different from the
                commuinty I knew. The opportunity for a completely new experience thrilled me. I wanted to taste East Coast
                life and now my perspectives and goals are even bigger.</p>

        <h3>What I Study and Why </h3>
        <h4>Marketing</h4>
        <p>I decided to pursue Marketing because understanding people and business fascinates me. Everyone is unique, but we
            all love certain things, people, animals, songs.
            <em>How are we different, how are we the same? And Why does it matter?</em>
        </p>
        <h4>Interactive Media</h4>
        <p> I also study Interactive Media. One of my favorite memories is the night of my high school art show. I displayed
            20 pieces I'd made in two years. I've always loved exploring my creativity and expressing myself through color,lines,and
            textures; and that night, I was able to show my friends and family a side that they did't all know about and
            I was able to see their reactions. While I still love stuido art, I'm now more interested in
            <strong>design</strong> and how to best display things for people to understand the content while also exciting them.
        </p>
        <h4>Computer Science</h4>
        <p>
            During Spring 2017 (Januaryâ€“June), I
            <dfn data-info="Northeastern has an experiential learning co-op program in which students do 6 month long internships to build on their classroom learning with real world experience.">co-oped</dfn> at Okta. It was a software company and I was in the Engineering Department, not on a team of engineers,
            but the Information Development team. I loved it. I had no notion of tech culture prior to my coop, but I liked
            it so much, I added computer science as a minor. Knowing that I can make things happen and change with software
            that I write, made me take on the challenge of getting into the coding game. I am a third year student in a lecture
            hall full of mostly freshmen who have been coding for years. I struggle to understand the right syntax for my
            assignments. But finding the solution, and learning while doing it, is so satisfying and so cool.
