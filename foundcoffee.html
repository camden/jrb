            </h3>
            <h4>Canned coffee sits heated and chilled in vending machines in Japan's metro. For my marketing managment class, I worked with a group of three other students to bring the same concept to our college campus. Our idea was to make this beverage "fun," "hip," and "cool." 
                <br>After learning that students find their favorite brands through word-of-mouth and choose those brands (think Glossier and Supreme) because of unique designs and packaging, I focused on making our branding distinct.
               I went for bright colors, line drawings, and animations.  </h4>
